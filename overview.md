- Distribute the force evenly downwards.
- Smaller at the top bigger at the bottom.
- Need an adhesive: friction

## **Ideation**
Method 1: Stepped tower method
1. Start by cutting the paper in half.
2. Fold both papers in half.
3. Open up one folded piece of paper and set it on a table.
4. Add some small pieces of paper on top for a flat surface.
5. Stack on top of each other.

Method 2: Standing book method
1. Cut the paper in half.
2. Cut one half in half.
3. Cut that half in half for 4 total pieces.
4. Fold all in half.
5. Cut a slit in the bottom vertically
6. Use the slits as friction adhesives by slotting it into the bottom piece of paper


## **Prototyping**


## **Testing and Critique**
107.2cm Tall testing tower.

Final design
1. Cut the paper in half.
2. Cut one half in half.
3. Cut that half in half for 4 total pieces.
4. Fold all in half.
5. Cut a slit in the bottom vertically of all papers except for the largest piece.
6. Stand the largest piece up on a flat surface.
7. Mount the second largest piece on top of the largest piece by opening the fold and attaching it in the opposite direction.
8. Use the slits as friction adhesives by slotting them into the bottom piece of paper that is standing vertically by opening the middle fold from step 4 slightly.
   
## **Conclusion**
Overall, this was moderately successful. It was not very stable but did provide enough stability to stay up on its own for a length of time (>30s).
